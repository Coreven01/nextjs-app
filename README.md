## Featured Projects 🌟

Here are some of the projects I've worked on while teaching myself React and Next.js.

### 1. Bomb Seeker
This is my faithful re-creation of Microsoft's original Minesweeper game. I have a couple optional additions that will auto start the game without clicking a bomb, and a cheat feature when the player encounters a situtation where they have to "guess".

### 2. Euchre
Simple implementation of the euchre card game. I decided to create this in Next.js to see what the framework was capable of and to test to see if I could get it working.
